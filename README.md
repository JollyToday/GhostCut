2. **[Auto Hard Sub Translation]** Automatically detect the text/subtitles in the video through OCR, calculate and extract text position, style, size in the video, and then use ChatGPT to translate the subtitles and paste them back according to the original text style and position, while performing inpainting on the original text area;
3. **[Auto Translation and dubbing]** Automatically extract the voice in the video through ASR and translate it, while using TTS to synthesize the translated text into voice.
